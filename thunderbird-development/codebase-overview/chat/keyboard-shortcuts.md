# Keyboard shortcuts

### Conversation window <a id="conversation_window"></a>

This is a list of keyboard shortcuts that are available in Thunderbird with brief descriptions of what they do.

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on your OS, the **Command** key may be **Ctrl**.
{% endhint %}

**Command + F** Find

**Escape** to put the conversation on hold

**Command + W** to close the current tab

**Command + Shift + H** for History \(Show Logs\)

**Command + \[Plus key\], Command + \[Minus key\]** - sets the Zoom level

**Command + 0** - resets the zoom level to 100%. \(Use the 0 key in the top row of the keyboard, not the 0 key of the numeric keypad.\)

### Scrolling the conversation

**Shift + PgUp/PgDn** scrolls a page up or down

**Home/End** or **Alt + PgUp/PgDn** scrolls to the previous/next section. Sections are

* the beginning and end of the conversation
* the beginning or end of a session \(in the log viewer\)
* the first non-context message
* the unread message ruler.

**When the textbox is empty**, the usual navigation keys \(**cursor keys, PgUp/Dn, ...**\) will scroll the conversation view also from the textbox.

### Contact list <a id="Contact_list"></a>

The available shortcuts are listed in the menu next to the commands.
