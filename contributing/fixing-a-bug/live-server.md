# Live Server

The Thunderbird live server works in exactly the same way to the [Firefox try server](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/TryServer) with a few minor differences. The automation is based on the same hardware and tools, so there should be few differences.

{% hint style="info" %}
Thunderbird's Live server is often referred to as "comm-central", or "cc", but usually it's just known as c-c. 
{% endhint %}

## Getting access to the Live Server <a id="getting-access-to-the-try-server"></a>

To use the live server, you'll need [Level 3 Commit Access](http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/commit-access-policy/). You can learn more about Mozilla's commit access policies and start the process of signing up for an account here: [Becoming a Mozilla Contributor](http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/)

## Adding Live to your Mercurial configuration

```text
[paths]
default = https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central
live-cc = ssh://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central
```

You can of course [access the repository via HTTP](https://hg.mozilla.org/try-comm-central/), but not push to it, hence the ssh:// address.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using the standard label `default-push` is not recommended. Having to type the name of the repository helps prevent mistakes.
{% endhint %}

## Before Pushing <a id="pushing-to-try"></a>

Is the tree open? Check [TreeHerder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=comm-central) â€“ the name of the tree in the top-left corner shows you the status of the tree. Usually it's "open" \(a green circle is displayed\), which means you can push. Other statuses are "approval required" \(yellow padlock\) and "closed" \(red X\) which mean you can't push without permission, and in fact the server will prevent you from doing so.

Is it a good time to push? The best time to push is shortly after Mozilla updates the Firefox live server. Since Thunderbird builds on top of Firefox, pushing to live then will ensure that the build will get the latest changes.

Mozilla usually updates the Firefox Live Server around **0400**, **1000**, **1600**, and **2200** **UTC** on weekdays and **1000 and 2200 UTC** on weekends \(give or take an hour\). If one of these times is approaching, it's probably not a good time to push. You can check [mozilla-central on TreeHerder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-central) to see when they last pushed.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Coordinate with others on IRC \(\#maildev\) as they may already be planning to push. A Firefox push is usually followed by an assigned person landing something to check the build is not broken.
{% endhint %}

Is there a build in progress already? If there is, please wait until you're reasonably sure the first build is not broken. In most cases this means that the Linux and OS X builds \(B\) are complete and tests \(bct, X\) are starting to turn green.

Is the tree green? If it isn't, do not push. Pushing something on top of an already broken build wastes resources \(both computing and human\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Pushing to comm-central will create builds using the **most recent** mozilla-central code, which may or may not be a good idea at the time. Generally it's okay, but there may be unresolved problems between the two repositories. If you strike a problem, ask on the \#maildev IRC channel.
{% endhint %}

## Pushing to Live <a id="pushing-to-try"></a>

Having gained level 3 access and configured Mercurial, you can push to Live. In general, it's just a matter of applying your patch\(es\) and running `hg push`, but let's not do that right now as a series of important checks need to happen before.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You should not push to the Live Server without having complete a successful push and build to the [Try Server](try-server.md).
{% endhint %}

### Steps before pushing to Live

These are a series of recommended steps to always go through before pushing to Live to ensure your Mercurial Queue is clean and you're pushing only what you need.

* Be sure your commit message is clear and has been approved during review. The standard syntax of a commit message is `Bug 000000 - Description of the patch and fix. r=reviewer`.
* Run `hg qpop -a` to clean your local queue.
* Run `hg in` to check if there are updates on the live server. \(This isn't strictly necessary if you always do the next step.\)
* Run `hg pull -u` to download and apply the most recent changes.
* Reorder your queue and run `hg qpush` to apply only the patches you want to push to Live.
* Run `hg qseries` to double check your applied patches.
* Run `hg qfinish --applied` to include all the currently applied patches in your local tree.
* Run `hg out` to see a list of patches that will be pushed to the Live server.
* Run `hg push live-cc` \(or any shorthand you used in your `hgrc` file\) to push your applied patches to the Live Server.

Take a look at the [TreeHerder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=comm-central) to see your push show up at the top of the list.

## After Pushing

If you worded your commit message correctly, a bot will post a message in your bug with a link to the changes you made, and close the bug. At this point you should set the Target Milestone field in the bug to the current version, which is generally, but not always, the last option for that field.
